# Supabase Connection Fix - Alternative Solutions

## Current Issue
Railway is still getting "self-signed certificate in certificate chain" errors even after the SSL fix.

## Solution 1: Use Supabase Connection Pooling URL

Try this connection string format in your Railway environment variables:

```
SUPABASE_DB_URL=postgresql://postgres.qwpxsufrgigpjcxtnery:6d9465b23f86855304c712c2393c5f867fa83165c0c49769fef74d363a9b8cc1@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?sslmode=require
```

**Key changes:**
- Uses `postgres.PROJECT_REF` format
- Uses port `6543` (pooling port)
- Uses `aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com` hostname
- Includes `sslmode=require`

## Solution 2: Force Railway Redeploy

The SSL fix might not have been deployed yet. Try:

1. **Trigger a new deployment** by making a small change to any file
2. **Or manually redeploy** in Railway dashboard

## Solution 3: Alternative SSL Configuration

If the above doesn't work, try this connection string:

```
SUPABASE_DB_URL=postgresql://postgres:6d9465b23f86855304c712c2393c5f867fa83165c0c49769fef74d363a9b8cc1@db.qwpxsufrgigpjcxtnery.supabase.co:5432/postgres?sslmode=require&sslcert=&sslkey=&sslrootcert=
```

## Steps to Try

1. **Update Railway Environment Variable** with Solution 1 URL
2. **Wait for redeploy** (should happen automatically)
3. **Check logs** for success messages
4. **If still failing**, try Solution 3

## Expected Success

After the fix, you should see:
```
Starting achievements worker
Health check server started
Starting event processing loop
Claimed queue batch: 0  # No SSL errors!
```

## Why This Happens

- Railway's Node.js environment has strict SSL certificate validation
- Supabase uses certificates that may not be in Railway's trust chain
- Connection pooling URLs often have better SSL compatibility
